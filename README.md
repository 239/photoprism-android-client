This Android app brings a convenient mobile gallery experience for [PhotoPrism](https://www.photoprism.app/).

It does not support all the official web app functionality, but nevertheless has plenty of useful features:
- Sending photos or videos to Gmail, Telegram or any other app
- Grouping the content by days and months
- Chronological scroll bar that lets you quickly jump to a specific month
- [Configurable search](https://github.com/Radiokot/photoprism-android-client/wiki/How-to-search-the-library)
- [Search bookmarks](https://github.com/Radiokot/photoprism-android-client/wiki/How-to-use-search-bookmarks) that let you save search configurations and apply them later
- Endless session without the need to re-enter the password
- [Connection to both private and public libraries](https://github.com/Radiokot/photoprism-android-client/wiki/Connection-guide)
- Support of [mTLS (mutual TLS)](https://github.com/Radiokot/photoprism-android-client/wiki/How-to-connect-to-a-library-with-mTLS-(mutual-TLS)-auth%3F) and [HTTP basic authentication](https://github.com/Radiokot/photoprism-android-client/wiki/Connection-guide)
- TV compatibility to easily browse your library with a remote-control

The gallery is not intended to sync content with the library. 
I recommend using [Autosync app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.autosync).

## Compatibility
The gallery is confirmed to work with PhotoPrism versions from 
[July 19, 2023](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/releases/tag/230719-73fa7bbe8) 
down to [October 9, 2021](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/releases/tag/211009-d6cc8df5). 
It may work with older ones though, I just haven't tested it.
The app uses [PhotoPrism Web Service API](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/api/), 
which serves only the original frontend needs and doesn't guarantee backward compatibility. 
When a new version of PhotoPrism comes out, the app may break.
