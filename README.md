# PhotoPrism Gallery

A native Android gallery for your [PhotoPrism library](https://www.photoprism.app/).

The official PhotoPrism PWA, despite being mobile-friendly, can't be integrated into the OS and has other drawbacks.
This app does not (and probably will not) support all the web-client features, but nevertheless it can:
- [x] Provide the library content to other Android apps – you can select PhotoPrism Gallery among other galleries when picking a photo or video
- [x] Open the library content in suitable apps – you can use your favorite image editor or video player instead of web viewer

## Other features
- [x] Chronological grouping
- [x] Search by media types and custom queries
- [ ] Saved searches
- [ ] Chronological fast scroll
- [ ] Endless session (no need to re-enter password)

## Content sync
The gallery is not intended to sync content with the library. I recommend using [Autosync app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.autosync).
