Changed:
- Made the fast scroll responsible â€“ the content will be loaded as you are dragging

Fixed:
- Duplication of gallery items, which happened to be at the edge of the data page
- Blinking of the empty view when the data is being loaded for the first time

Added:
- Infinite scrolling (swiping?) in the media viewer
- Clearing of the app internal downloads directory on startup, which frees "Data" storage
