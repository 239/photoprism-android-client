Fixed:
- Resetting photo zoom in the media viewer when setting or unsetting the photo favorite or private

Added:
- Ability to change the download behavior for RAWs in the preferences: you can choose between downloading the original file or a compatible JPEG, if available

Changed:
- Switched to a script-based Traditional/Simplified Chinese selection, which should make it more accurate

Removed:
- Redundant encryption of the stored credentials and library connection parameters. The data is still securely stored in the app's private folder where no other apps can read it. It is just no longer additionally encrypted
