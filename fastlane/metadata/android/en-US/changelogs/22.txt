Fixed:
- Showing some gallery entries under the wrong day occasionally.<br>
Now, if a photo is taken on July 4th at 23:18 in Montenegro,
its time is displayed and treated as July 4th, 23:18
regardless of whether the gallery is viewed from Montenegro, USA or the Moon.
- Inability to connect to a library running on a slow server due to the timeout error

Added:
- Display of the item title and date in the media viewer
