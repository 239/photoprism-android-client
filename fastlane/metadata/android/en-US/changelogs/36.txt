Full changelog:

Changed:
- Updated video player library. If you have playback problems, consider checking out this version
- Slideshow made looped: once reached the end, it restarts from the first slide

Added:
- German translation
- Web portal auth: if your library is secured with Authelia, Umbrel, Cloudflare Access or any other proxy requiring authentication, it should be doable with this update. Once the auth cookies are expired, you'll be asked for authentication again

Fixed:
- In slideshow, immediate slide switch after going to a previous slide if it is a video
- Not loading library content if there is a video with more than 2 billion frames
