Changed:
- Trust installed user CA so it is possible to use HTTPS with self-signed certificates
- Make env connection and content loading errors show the short summary of the cause

Fixed:
- "Library is not accessible" during the connection, when the entered root URL doesn't match the
PHOTOPRISM_SITE_URL server config value
