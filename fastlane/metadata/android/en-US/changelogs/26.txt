Added:
- A notice suggesting to use the mouse to search the library,
which is shown in the search bar when the app is running on a TV
- Distinctive `User-Agent` to be shown in the PhotoPrism sessions list
- Going full screen automatically when viewing a video
- Closing media viewer by swiping up or down
- Automatic update of album and people lists when re-opening the app after it has been moved
to the background by pressing the "Back" navigation button.

Changed:
- Improved quality of the viewed photos. Now the app loads corresponding previews
according to the screen size. This, however, may increase network load
- Split the welcome screen layout into 2 columns on wide landscape screens
- Limited the max width of the search bar
- The "X" button now exits the selection mode instead of just clearing,
if the selection is initiated by a long press

Fixed:
- Crash when clicking the "Apply" button on the search screen twice
- Media viewer failing to load very big images
- Missing player controls when viewing video in rare cases
