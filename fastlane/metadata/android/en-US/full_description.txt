This app brings a convenient mobile gallery experience for PhotoPrism.
It does not support all the official web app functionality, but nevertheless has plenty of useful features:
- Sending photos or videos to Gmail, Telegram or any other app
- Grouping the content by days and months
- Chronological scroll bar that lets you quickly jump to a specific month
- Configurable search
- Search bookmarks that let you save search configurations and apply them later
- Enhanced live photo viewer, looks best with Samsung and Apple shots
- Endless session without the need to re-enter the password
- Connection to both private and public libraries
- Support of mTLS (mutual TLS) and HTTP basic authentication
- TV compatibility to easily browse your library with a remote-control (Search is only available with a mouse for now)

The gallery is confirmed to work with PhotoPrism versions from October 21, 2023 down to October 9, 2021
