The official PhotoPrism PWA, despite being mobile-friendly, can't be integrated into the OS and has other drawbacks. This app does not (and probably will not) support all the web-client features, but nevertheless it can:
- Provide the library content to other Android apps – you can select PhotoPrism Gallery among other galleries when picking a photo or video
- Open the library content in suitable apps – you can use your favorite image editor or video player instead of web viewer

There are more handy features in the gallery:
- Chronological grouping
- Search by media types and custom queries
- Endless session (you don't have to re-enter the password)
- Connection to both private and public libraries
- [Upcoming] Chronological fast scroll
- [Upcoming] Saved searches

The gallery is confirmed to work with PhotoPrism versions from November 18, 2022 down to October 9, 2021
